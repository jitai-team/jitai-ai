### 🌟 AI-Native Architecture

JitAI is built on **[JAAP (Jit AI Application Protocol)](https://jit.pro/docs/reference/runtime-platform/JAAP)**, enabling true AI-driven development:

| Capability | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **🧠 Full-Stack Module Perception** | All system modules are self-describing. AI can perceive and understand their functions, parameters, and usage in real-time |
| **🎮 Intelligent Driving & Orchestration** | AI dynamically calls and orchestrates any module using unified syntax, enabling autonomous business process planning and execution |
| **🤝 Human-AI Collaboration** | AI and humans collaborate within the same UI. AI can manipulate frontend components (generate charts, fill forms, etc.) |

## 🆚 Community vs Enterprise

JitAI offers two editions for the AI framework: **Community Edition** and **Enterprise Edition**.

| Feature Module | Capability | 🟢 Community Edition | 🔵 Enterprise Edition |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **LLM Foundation** | All Model Types Support | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Vector Database** | Chroma DB Support | ✅ | ✅ |
